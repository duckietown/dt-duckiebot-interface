    """Object communicating to the LEDs.

        Low level class that creates the PWM messages that are sent to the
        microcontroller. It contains offset addresses relatives to the
        address of the various LEDs.

        Each LED on a Duckiebot or a watchtower is indexed by a number:

        +------------------+------------------------------------------+
        | Index            | Position (rel. to direction of movement) |
        +==================+==========================================+

        +------------------+------------------------------------------+
        | 1                | Rear left                                |

        Setting the color of a single LED is done by setting the brightness of the
        red, green, and blue channels to a value between 0 and 255. The communication
        with the hardware controller is abstracted through the :obj:`setRGB` method. By
        using it, you can set directly set the desired color to any LED.
