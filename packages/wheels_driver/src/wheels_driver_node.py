    """Node handling the motor velocities communication.

        Subscribes to the requested wheels commands (linear velocities, i.e. velocity for the left and
        the right wheels) and to an emergency stop flag. When the emergency flag `~emergency_stop` is set to
        `False` it actuates the wheel driver with the velocities received from `~wheels_cmd`. Publishes
        the execution of the commands to `~wheels_cmd_executed`.

        The emergency flag is `False` by default.

        Subscribers:
           ~wheels_cmd (:obj:`WheelsCmdStamped`): The requested wheel command
           ~emergency_stop (:obj:`BoolStamped`): Emergency stop. Can stop the actual execution of the
               wheel commands by the motors if set to `True`. Set to `False` for nominal operations.
        Publishers:
           ~wheels_cmd_executed (:obj:`WheelsCmdStamped`): Publishes the actual commands executed, i.e. when
               the emergency flag is `False` it publishes the requested command, and when it is `True`: zero
               values for both motors.
