led\_emitter package
====================

.. contents::

The `led_emitter` package provides the drivers that control the LEDs of a Duckiebot.
It provides a convenient API for turning the LEDs on and off, changing their color and making
them blink with various frequencies. You can see examples how to do that in the description of the `LEDEmitterNode` class bellow.
